# Idols 100x AI-NFT

## What it does

Idols 100x is an NFT-based virtual idol project. 

We provide virtual idol NFTs that can be customized and traded at will.



The problem it solves


Currently, there are many ChatBots in the Web2 field. The classic idea is that users can train the robots themselves, or officially set them up to provide services to the users. 

There are several shortcomings here:



 1. The user himself is not necessarily an excellent trainer and cannot train a perfect chatbot.

 2. The officially produced chatbot templates are limited and have limited personality, and they are often produced by technology companies rather than professional idol broker teams.



In fact, the idol broker company mechanism in the real world has provided a good idea, that is, idols are generated through economic market competition (of course it can also be an idol chatbot):



 1. It is operated by a broker company which is a professional team that does the character design.

 2. Idols can be traded after they are trained, so brokers have the motivation to discover amateur idols and make them up.

 3. As the income base of famous idols, the fan economy is attractive for income, so large economic companies will buy half-trained idols at the appropriate stage for operation.



Technologies I used
