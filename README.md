An AIaaNFT project that uses NFT to tokenize Web2 AI services and APIs including ChatGPT and VectorDB.

## What it does


Idols-100x is an NFT-based virtual idol project. 

Essentially we implemented AIaaNFT, using NFT to tokenize Web2 AI services and APIs such as ChatGPT and VectorDB.

We made the virtual idols NFTs that can be customized and traded at will. 

Through fair market competition, creators can benefit from making better chatbots and trading them, eventually professionalizing the virtual idol economy market.

## The problem it solves


Currently, there are many ChatBots in the Web2 field. The classic idea is that users can train the robots themselves, or officially set them up to provide services to the users. 

There are several shortcomings here:

1. The user himself is not necessarily an excellent trainer and cannot train a perfect chatbot.

2. The officially produced chatbot templates are limited and have limited personality, and they are often produced by technology companies rather than professional idol broker teams.

3. There is no financial reward for excellent chatbot creators, and there is a lack of a trading market for chatbot production.


In fact, the idol agent team mechanism in the real world has provided a good idea, that is, idols are generated through economic market competition. And of course, it can also be a virtual idol chatbot:

1. It is operated by an agent which is a professional team that does the character design, storytelling, and organizing virtual idol activities. As creators, they are more dynamic than a single company providing all the chatbots and more professional than individual training.

2. Virtual idols can be traded before and after they are trained as NFTs, so agents have the motivation to buy low-quality virtual idols which are cheaper, train them well to raise the price and make a profit from them.

3. Users will have a huge selection of virtual idols to choose from, and agents will receive incentives as creators. NFT make the transfer of virtual idols smooth, and the FT key allows loyal users to benefit from the growth of virtual idols.


## Technologies we used


NFT, FriendsTech Key, VectorDB, ChatGPT - AIaaNFT

NFT is used to tokenize the virtual idols and the FT Key is used as the access key to the virtual idol chatbot service.

VectorDB is used to store the virtual idol's story data, which makes the virtual idol full, with a complete history and life experience, so they are able to be more real and expandable.

ChatGPT is used to generate the dialogues of the virtual idols followed by the idols' experience, story and character, which makes the virtual idol more interactive and interesting.


## How we built it


Players can participate as fans or agents:

Fans purchase the FT Key of a virtual idol to obtain chat with their idols; 

The agent purchases amateur virtual idols NFTs, trains them better and then promotes them to the fans to earn income. Or sell them in the market to lock the value.

Highly customizable and tradable are the characteristics of this project.
